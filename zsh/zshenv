# `.zshenv`
#
# [Read every time]
#
# This file is always sourced, so it should set environment variables which
# need to be updated frequently. PATH (or its associated counterpart path) is a
# good example because you probably don't want to restart your whole session to
# make it update. By setting it in that file, reopening a terminal emulator will
# start a new Zsh instance with the PATH value updated.
#
# But be aware that this file is read even when Zsh is launched to run a single
# command (with the -c option), even by another tool like make. You should be
# very careful to not modify the default behavior of standard commands because it
# may break some tools (by setting aliases for example).
