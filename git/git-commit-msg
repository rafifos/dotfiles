A good commit message looks like this:

  Header line: explain the commit in one line (use the imperative)

  Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
  in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
  being fixed, etc etc.

  The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
  please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
  72 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
  nicely even when it's indented.

  Make sure you explain your solution and why you're doing what you're
  doing, as opposed to describing what you're doing. Reviewers and your
  future self can read the patch, but might not understand why a
  particular solution was implemented.
