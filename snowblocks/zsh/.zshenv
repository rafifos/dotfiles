# ~/.zshenv: Sourced on ALL invocations of ZSH(1), unless the -f option is
# set.
#
# NOTE: It should NOT normally contain commands to set the command search path,
# or other common environment variables unless you really know what you're
# doing. E.g. running "PATH=/custom/path gdb program" sources this file (when
# gdb runs the program via $SHELL), so you want to be sure not to override a
# custom environment in such cases.  Note also that .zshenv should not contain
# commands that produce output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
