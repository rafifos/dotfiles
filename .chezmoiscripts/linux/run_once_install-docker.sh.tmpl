# Installs Docker.
#
# Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
# Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so
# you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your
# infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking
# advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code
# quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and
# running it in production.
